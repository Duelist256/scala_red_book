     Now that we have a representation of Prop, implement && and || for composing Prop
     values. Notice that in the case of failure we donâ€™t know which property was responsible,
     the left or the right. Can you devise a way of handling this, perhaps by allowing
     Prop values to be assigned a tag or label which gets displayed in the event of a failure?*/
